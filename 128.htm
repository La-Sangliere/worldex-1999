<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Ethiopia remains one of the least developed countries in the world. Its
economy is based on agriculture, which accounts for more than half of GDP,

90% of exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of export
earnings. The agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought,
poor cultivation practices, and deterioration of internal security
conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs from
the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but less than

10% of agriculture, is state-run. The government is considering selling off
a portion of state-owned plants and is implementing reform measures that
are gradually liberalizing the economy. A major medium-term problem is the
improvement of roads, water supply, and other parts of an infrastructure
badly neglected during years of civil strife. Renewed fighting with Eritrea

dims economic prospects for 1999.
