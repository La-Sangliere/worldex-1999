<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Turkmenistan is largely desert country with nomadic cattle raising,
intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and huge gas and oil resources.
One-half of its irrigated land is planted in cotton, making it the world's
tenth largest producer. It also possesses the world's fifth largest
reserves of natural gas and substantial oil resources. Until the end of
1993, Turkmenistan had experienced less economic disruption than other

former Soviet states because its economy received a boost from higher
prices for oil and gas and a sharp increase in hard currency earnings. In
1994, Russia's refusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and
mounting debts of its major customers in the former USSR for gas deliveries
contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and caused the budget

to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit. The economy bottomed out in
1996, but high inflation continued. Furthermore, with an authoritarian
ex-communist regime in power and a tribally based social structure,
Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to
use gas and cotton sales to sustain its inefficient economy. In 1996, the

government set in place a stabilization program aimed at a unified and
market-based exchange rate, allocation of government credits by auction,
and strict limits on budget deficits. Privatization goals remain limited.
Turkmenistan is working hard to open new gas export channels through Iran
and Turkey to Europe, but these will take many years to realize. In 1998

Turkmenistan faced revenue shortfalls due to the continued lack of adequate
export routes for natural gas and obligations on extensive short-term
external debt.
