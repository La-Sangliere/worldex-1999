Background:</b> 
Iraq lies in the lower part of the Tigris-Euphrates valley, the heart of
one of the four great ancient civilizations. The area was overrun by Arab,
Mongol, and Turkish conquerors and became a British mandate following World

War I. Independence came in 1932. Iraq's pro-Western stance ended in 1958
with the overthrow of the monarchy. Its subsequent turbulent history has
witnessed the dictatorship of SADDAM Husayn, civil war with the Kurds, a
bloody conflict with neighboring Iran, and, in 1990, an invasion of Kuwait,
swiftly turned back by a Western coalition led by the US. Noncooperation

with UN Security Council resolution obligations and the UN's inspection of
Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological, and long-range missile weapons
programs remain major problems.

destruction of the natural habitat poses serious threats to the area's
wildlife populations; inadequate supplies of potable water; development of
Tigris-Euphrates Rivers system contingent upon agreements with upstream
riparian Turkey; air and water pollution; soil degradation (salination) and
erosion; desertification

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Iraq's economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which has
traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the
1980s, financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year
war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran led the

government to implement austerity measures, borrow heavily, and later
reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq suffered economic losses of at least
$100 billion from the war. After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil
exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and
restoration of damaged facilities. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990,

subsequent international economic embargoes, and military action by an
international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically reduced
economic activity and increased prices. The Iraqi Government has been
unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so that the economic embargo could be
removed. The government's policies of supporting large military and

internal security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters of
the regime have exacerbated shortages. The implementation of the UN's
oil-for-food program in December 1996 has helped improve economic
conditions. For the first three six-month phases of the program, Iraq was

allowed to export $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for food, medicine,
and other humanitarian goods. The UN allowed Iraq to export $5.2 billion of
oil beginning with the fourth phase of the program in May 1998. At an
average volume of 1.9 million barrels per day during the last half of 1998,
oil exports are about three-quarters their prewar level. Per capita food

imports have increased significantly, while medical supplies and health
care services are steadily improving. Per capita output and living
standards are still well below the prewar level, but any estimates have a
wide range of error.

Disputes&#151;international:</b> 
Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in 1990 but are still trying to
work out written agreements settling outstanding disputes from their
eight-year war concerning border demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom

of navigation and sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; in November
1994, Iraq formally accepted the UN-demarcated border with Kuwait which had
been spelled out in Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991), 773 (1993),
and 883 (1993); this formally ends earlier claims to Kuwait and to Bubiyan
and Warbah islands although the government continues periodic rhetorical

challenges; dispute over water development plans by Turkey for the Tigris
and Euphrates Rivers
