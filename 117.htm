Background:</b> 
Once part of the Holy Roman Empire and, later, the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy, Czechoslovakia became an independent nation at the end of World
War I. Independence ended with the German takeover in 1939. After World War
II, Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet sphere of influence, and in 1968

an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops snuffed out anti-communist demonstrations
and riots. With the collapse of Soviet authority in 1991, Czechoslovakia
regained its freedom. On 1 January 1993, the country peacefully split into
its two ethnic components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech
Republic, largely by aspiring to become a NATO and EU member, has moved

toward integration in world markets, a development that poses both
opportunities and risks. But Prague has had a difficult time convincing the
public that membership in NATO is crucial to Czech security. At the same
time, support for eventual EU membership is waning. Coupled with the
country's worsening economic situation, Prague's political scene, troubled

for the past three years, will remain so for the foreseeable future.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Political and financial crises in 1997 shattered the Czech Republic's image
as one of the most stable and prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays
in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning
capital market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which

culminated in a currency crisis in May. The currency was forced out of its
fluctuation band as investors worried that the current account deficit,
which reached nearly 8% of GDP in 1996, would become unsustainable. After
expending $3 billion in vain to support the currency, the central bank let
it float. The growing current account imbalance reflected a surge in

domestic demand and poor export performance, as wage increases outpaced
productivity. The government was forced to introduce two austerity packages
later in the spring which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. A tough
1998 budget continued the painful medicine. These problems were compounded
in the summer of 1997 by unprecedented flooding which inundated much of the

eastern part of the country. Czech difficulties contrast with earlier
achievements of strong GDP growth, a balanced budget, and inflation and
unemployment that were among the lowest in the region. The Czech economy's
transition problems continue to be too much direct and indirect government
influence on the privatized economy, the sometimes ineffective management

of privatized firms, and a shortage of experienced financial analysts for
the banking system. The country slipped into a mild recession in 1998, but
hopes to rebound with 1% growth in 1999.
