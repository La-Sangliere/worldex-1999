<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse
weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances from abroad, and
counterproductive economic policies. The private sector's main areas of
activity are agriculture and trading, with most private industrial
investment predating 1980. Agriculture employs 80% of the work force.
Industry mainly processes agricultural items. Sluggish economic performance

over the past decade, attributable largely to declining annual rainfall,
has kept per capita income at low levels. A large foreign debt and huge
arrears continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary
Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its
nonpayment of arrears to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked on promised

reforms in 1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from the Fund. To
avoid expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make payments on its arrears to the
Fund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies, measures it has
partially implemented. The government's continued prosecution of the civil
war and its growing international isolation continued to inhibit growth in

the nonagricultural sectors of the economy during 1998. Hyperinflation has
raised consumer prices above the reach of most. In 1998, a top priority was
to develop potentially lucrative oilfields in southcentral Sudan; the
government is working with foreign partners to exploit the oil sector.
