Background:</b> 
For centuries Byelorussia has been fought over, devastated, and partitioned
among Russia, Poland, Lithuania, and, in World Wars I and II, Germany.

After seven decades as a Soviet republic, the newly named Belarus declared
its independence in August 1991. It has retained closer political and
economic ties to Russia than any of the other former Soviet republics. On
25 December 1998, Russian President Boris YEL'TSIN and Belarusian President
Aleksandr LUKASHENKO signed several agreements intended to provide greater

political, economic, and social integration while preserving both states'
sovereignty.

Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Belarus has seen little structural reform since 1995, when President
LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of "market socialism". In
keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO re-imposed administrative controls

over prices and currency exchange rates and expanded the state's right to
intervene in the management of private enterprise. This produced a climate
hostile to private business, inhibiting domestic and foreign investment.
The Government of Belarus has artificially revived economic output since
mid-1996 by pursuing a policy of rapid credit expansion. In a vain attempt

to keep the rapidly rising inflation in check, the government placed strict
price controls on food and consumer products, which resulted in food
shortages. Long lines for dairy products, chicken, and pork became common
in the closing months of 1998. With the goal of slowing down the

devaluation of the Belarusian ruble, LUKASHENKO in 1997 introduced a new,
complex system of legal buying/selling hard currencies. The new "command"
system proved to be totally unworkable and resulted in galloping
devaluation. In addition to the burdens imposed on businesses by high
inflation and an artificial currency regime, businesses have also been

subject to pressure on the part of central and local governments, e.g.,
arbitrary changes in regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, and
retroactive application of new business regulations prohibiting practices
that had been legal. A further economic problem is the sizable trade
deficit.
