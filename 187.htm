Background:</b> 
A country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions,
Kyrgyzstan became part of the Russian empire in 1864. In the Czarist and

Soviet periods, Russian managers and technicians were sent to Kyrgyzstan
and have recently made up more than one-fifth of the population. Many
Russians have been returning home since Kyrgyzstan gained its independence
in 1991 when the USSR collapsed. Privatization of state-owned enterprises,
expansion of democracy and political freedoms, and inter-ethnic relations

are current issues.

Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country with a predominantly
agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are the main agricultural
products and exports. Industrial exports include gold, mercury, uranium,
and hydropower. Kyrgyzstan has been one of the most progressive countries
of the former Soviet Union in carrying out market reforms. Following a
successful stabilization program, which lowered inflation from 88% in 1994

to 15% for 1997, attention is turning toward stimulating growth. Much of
the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in production
have been severe since the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991,
but by mid-1995 production began to recover and exports began to increase.
Pensioners, unemployed workers, and government workers with salary arrears

continue to suffer. Foreign assistance played a substantial role in the
country's economic turnaround in 1996-97. The government has adopted a
series of measures to combat some of the severe economic problems such as
excessive debt and inadequate revenue collection, encountered in 1998.
