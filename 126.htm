Background:</b> 
On 29 May 1991, ISAIAS Afworki, secretary general of the People's Front for
Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), which then served as the country's
legislative body, announced the formation of the Provisional Government in
Eritrea (PGE) in preparation for the 23-25 April 1993 referendum on

independence from Ethiopia. The referendum resulted in a landslide vote for
independence, which became effective on 24 May 1993.

following a successful referendum on independence for the Autonomous Region

note:</i> 
in May 1995 the National Assembly adopted a resolution stating that the
administrative structure of Eritrea, which had been established by former

colonial powers, would consist of only six provinces when the new
constitution, then being drafted, became effective in 1997; the new
provinces, the names of which had not been recommended by the US Board on
Geographic Names for recognition by the US Government, pending acceptable
definition of the boundaries, were: Anseba, Debub, Debubawi Keyih Bahri,

Gash-Barka, Maakel, and Semanawi Keyih Bahri; more recently, it has been
reported that these provinces have been redesignated regions and renamed
Southern Red Sea, Northern Red Sea, Anseba, Gash-Barka, Southern, and

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
With independence from Ethiopia on 24 May 1993, Eritrea faced the bitter
economic problem of a small, desperately poor African country. The economy
is largely based on subsistence agriculture, with over 70% of the
population involved in farming and herding. The small industrial sector
consists mainly of light industries with outmoded technologies. Domestic
output (GDP) is substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad.

Government revenues come from custom duties and taxes on income and sales.
Road construction is a top domestic priority. Eritrea has long-term
prospects for revenues from the development of offshore oil, offshore
fishing, and tourism. Eritrea's economic future depends on its ability to
master fundamental social and economic problems, e.g., overcoming

illiteracy, promoting job creation, expanding technical training,
attracting foreign investment, and streamlining the bureaucracy. The most
immediate threat to the economy, however, is the possible expansion of the
armed conflict with Ethiopia.
