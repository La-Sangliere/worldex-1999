Background:</b> 

Serbia and Montenegro have asserted the formation of a joint independent
state, but this entity has not been formally recognized as a state by the
US. The US view is that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)
has dissolved and that none of the successor republics represents its
continuation.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in 1991 has been followed by
highly destructive warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and
the breakup of important interrepublic trade flows. Output in Serbia and
Montenegro dropped by half in 1992-93. Like the other former Yugoslav
republics, it had depended on its sister republics for large amounts of

energy and manufactures. Wide differences in climate, mineral resources,
and levels of technology among the republics accentuated this
interdependence, as did the communist practice of concentrating much
industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup of many of

the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial plants lost
suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in the
fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the
republics. One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia is the
continuation in office of a government that is primarily interested in

political and military mastery, not economic reform. Hyperinflation ended
with the establishment of a new currency unit in June 1993; prices were
relatively stable from 1995 through 1997, but inflationary pressures
resurged in 1998. Reliable statistics continue to be hard to come by, and
the GDP estimate is extremely rough. The economic boom anticipated by the

government after the suspension of UN sanctions in December 1995 has failed
to materialize. Government mismanagement of the economy is largely to
blame. Also, the Outer Wall sanctions that exclude Belgrade from
international financial institutions and an investment ban and asset freeze
imposed in 1998 because of Belgrade's repressive actions in Kosovo have

added to economic difficulties.
