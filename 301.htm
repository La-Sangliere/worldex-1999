Background:</b> 
Britain, the dominant industrial and maritime power of the nineteenth
century, played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in
advancing literature and science. The British Empire covered approximately
one-fourth of the earth's surface at its zenith. In the first half of the
twentieth century its strength was seriously depleted by two world wars.
Since the end of World War II, the British Empire has been dismantled, and

Britain has rebuilt itself into a prosperous, modern European nation with
significant international political, cultural, and economic influence. As
the twentieth century draws to a close, Britain is debating the degree of
its integration with continental Europe. While a member of the EU, for the
time being it is staying out of the euro system introduced in January 1999.

Constitutional reform, including the House of Lords and the devolution of
power to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, is an ongoing issue in
Great Britain.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial centers,
and its essentially capitalistic economy ranks among the four largest in
Western Europe. Over the past two decades the government has greatly
reduced public ownership and contained the growth of social welfare
programs. Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by

European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the
labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary
energy production accounts for 10% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and business
services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while industry

continues to decline in importance, now employing only 18% of the work
force. Economic growth is slowing, and Britain may experience a short
recession in 1999. As a result, unemployment probably will begin to rise
again. The BLAIR government has put off the question of participation in
the euro system until after the next election, not expected until 2001, but

Chancellor of the Exchequer BROWN is committed to preparing the British
economy for eventual membership.
