<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly dependent on
farming and livestock raising (sheep and goats). Economic considerations
have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals during two
decades of war, including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation
(which ended 15 February 1989). During that conflict one-third of the
population fled the country, with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined

peak of more than 6 million refugees. Now, only 750,000 registered Afghan
refugees remain in Pakistan and about 1.2 million in Iran. Another 1
million have probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.
Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 20 years
because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade and

transport. Much of the population continues to suffer from insufficient
food, clothing, housing, and medical care. Inflation remains a serious
problem throughout the country, with one estimate putting the rate at 240%
in Kabul in 1996. International aid can deal with only a fraction of the

humanitarian problem, let alone promote economic development. Government
efforts to encourage foreign investment have not worked. The economic
situation did not improve in 1998. Numerical data are likely to be either
unavailable or unreliable.
