<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Growth in global output (gross world product, GWP) dropped to 2% in 1998
from 4% in 1997 because of continued recession in Japan, severe financial
difficulties in other East Asian countries, and widespread dislocations in
the Russian economy. The US economy continued its remarkable sustained

prosperity, growing at 3.9% in 1998, and accounted for 22% of GWP. Western
Europe's economies grew at roughly 2.5%, not enough to cut deeply into the
region's high unemployment; these economies produced 21% of GWP. China, the
second largest economy in the world, continued its rapid growth and
accounted for 11% of GWP. Japan posted a decline of 2.6% in 1998 and its

share in GWP dropped to 7.4%. As usual, the 15 successor nations of the
USSR and the other old Warsaw Pact nations experienced widely different
rates of growth. Russia's national product dropped by 5% whereas the
nations of central and eastern Europe grew by 3.4% on average. The
developing nations varied widely in their growth results, with many

countries facing population increases that eat up gains in output.
Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock economic-political institution,
is steadily losing control over international flows of people, goods,
funds, and technology. Internally, the central government finds its control
over resources slipping as separatist regional movements&#151;typically based

on ethnicity&#151;gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of the former
Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, and in Canada. In Western
Europe, governments face the difficult political problem of channeling
resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and
strengthen incentives to seek employment. The addition of more than 80

million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating
the problems of pollution, desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and
famine. Because of their own internal problems, the industrialized
countries have inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer

areas of the world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are
becoming further marginalized. In 1998, serious financial difficulties in
several high-growth East Asia countries cast a shadow over short-term
global economic prospects. The introduction of the euro as the common
currency of much of Western Europe in January 1999 poses serious economic

risks because of varying levels of income and cultural and political
differences among the participating nations. (For specific economic
developments in each country of the world in 1998, see the individual
country entries.)
