Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and
other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private
trading and service ventures. President KHATAMI has continued to follow the

market reform plans of former President RAFSANJANI and has indicated that
he will pursue diversification of Iran's oil-reliant economy although he
has made little progress toward that goal. In the early 1990s, Iran
experienced a financial crisis and was forced to reschedule $15 billion in
debt. The strong oil market in 1996 helped ease financial pressures on Iran

and allowed for Tehran's timely debt service payments. Iran's financial
situation tightened in 1997 and deteriorated further in 1998 because of
lower oil prices. As a result Iran has begun to cut imports and fall into
arrears on its debt payments.

Disputes&#151;international:</b> 

Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in 1990 but are still trying to
work out written agreements settling outstanding disputes from their
eight-year war concerning border demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom
of navigation and sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; Iran
occupies two islands in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE: Lesser Tunb
(called Tunb as Sughra in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Kuchek in

Persian by Iran) and Greater Tunb (called Tunb al Kubra in Arabic by UAE
and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg in Persian by Iran); it jointly administers
with the UAE an island in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE (called Abu
Musa in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Abu Musa in Persian by Iran)&#151;over
which Iran has taken steps to exert unilateral control since 1992,

including access restrictions and a military build-up on the island; the
UAE has garnered significant diplomatic support in the region in protesting
these Iranian actions; Caspian Sea boundaries are not yet determined among
Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan



<p>
<b>
Illicit drugs:</b> 
despite substantial interdiction efforts, Iran remains a key transshipment
point for Southwest Asian heroin to Europe; domestic consumption of
narcotics remains a persistent problem and Iranian press reports estimate
that there are at least 1.2 million drug users in the country
