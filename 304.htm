pesticides is the cause of many human health disorders; increasing soil
salination; soil contamination from agricultural chemicals, including DDT

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 10% consists of intensely
cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It was one of the poorest areas of the
former Soviet Union with more than 60% of its population living in densely
populated rural communities. Uzbekistan is now the world's third largest
cotton exporter, a major producer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally
significant producer of chemicals and machinery. Following independence in

December 1991, the government sought to prop up its Soviet-style command
economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and prices. Faced
with high rates of inflation, however, the government began to reform in
mid-1994, by introducing tighter monetary policies, expanding
privatization, slightly reducing the role of the state in the economy, and

improving the environment for foreign investors. Nevertheless, the state
continues to be a dominating influence in the economy, and reforms have so
far failed to bring about much-needed structural changes. The IMF suspended
Uzbekistan's $185 million standby arrangement in late 1996 because of
governmental steps that made impossible fulfillment of Fund conditions.

Uzbekistan has responded to the negative external conditions generated by
the Asian and Russian financial crises by tightening export and currency
controls within its already largely closed economy.
