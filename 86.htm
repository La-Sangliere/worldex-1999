Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Possessing large and well-developed agricultural, mining, manufacturing,
and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs that of all other South
American countries and is expanding its presence in world markets. Prior to
the institution of a stabilization plan&#151;the Plano Real (Real Plan) in
mid-1994, stratospheric inflation rates had disrupted economic activity and
discouraged foreign investment. Since then, tight monetary policy has

brought inflation under control&#151;consumer prices increased by 2% in 1998
compared to more than 1,000% in 1994. At the same time, GDP growth slowed
from 5.7% in 1994 to about 3.0% in 1997 due to tighter credit. The Real
Plan faced its strongest challenge in 1998, as the world financial crisis
caused investors to more closely examine the country's structural

weaknesses. The most severe spillover for Brazil&#151;after Russia's debt
default in August 1998&#151;created unrelenting pressure on the currency which
forced the country to hike annual interest rates to 50%. Approximately $30
billion in capital left the country in August and September. After crafting
a fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on structural reform,

Brazil received a $41.5 billion IMF-led international support program in
November 1998. Capital continued to leach out of the country, and
investors, concerned about the rising mountain of debt and currency
widely-viewed as overvalued, stayed on the sidelines. In January 1999,
Brazil made an abrupt shift of course in exchange rate policy, abandoning

the strong currency anti-inflation anchor of the Real Plan. On 13 January
1999, Central Bank officials announced a one-time 8% devaluation of the
real, and on 15 January 1999, the currency was declared to be freely
floating. President CARDOSO remains committed to limiting inflation and
weathering the financial crisis through austerity and sacrifice as the

country rides out a deep recession. He hopes the country will resume
economic growth in the second half of 1999, so that he can once again focus
on his longer-term goal of reducing poverty and income inequality. CARDOSO
still hopes to address mandated revenue sharing with the states and
cumbersome procedures to amend the constitution before the end of his

second term.
