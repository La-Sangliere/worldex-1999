Background:</b> 
The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included in
the data below, unless otherwise noted. In keeping with the framework
established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral
negotiations are being conducted between Israel and Palestinian

representatives, and Israel and Syria, to achieve a permanent settlement
between them. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to
the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace treaty. Outstanding territorial and other
disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan

Treaty of Peace.

<p>
<b>
Constitution:</b>

<b>
Legal system:</b> 

mixture of English common law, British Mandate regulations, and, in
personal matters, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim legal systems; in December

elections:</i> 

president elected by the Knesset for a five-year term; election last held 4
March 1998 (next to be held NA March 2003); prime minister elected by
popular vote for a four-year term; election last held 29 May 1996 (early
elections are scheduled for 17 May 1999); note&#151;in March 1992, the Knesset
approved legislation, effective in 1996, which allowed for the direct

election of the prime minister; under the new law, each voter casts two
ballots&#151;one for the direct election of the prime minister and one for the
party in the Knesset; the candidate that receives the largest percentage of
the popular vote then works to form a coalition with other parties to
achieve a parliamentary majority of 61 seats; finally, the candidate must

submit his or her cabinet to the Knesset for approval and this must be done
within 45 days of the election; in contrast to the old system, under the
new law, the prime minister's party need not be the single-largest party in
the Knesset


<br><i>
election results:</i> 
Ezer WEIZMAN reelected president by the Knesset with a total of 63 votes,
other candidate, Shaul AMOR, received 49 votes (there were seven

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Israel has a technologically advanced market economy with substantial
government participation. It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw
materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources,
Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors
over the past 20 years. Manufacturing and construction employ about 28% of
Israeli workers; agriculture, forestry, and fishing 2.6%; and services the

rest. Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production except for
grains. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products
(fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable
current account deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments from
abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt

is owed to the US, which is its major source of economic and military aid.
The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR topped 750,000 during
the period 1989-98, bringing the population of Israel from the former
Soviet Union to one million, one-sixth of the total population and adding
scientific and professional expertise of substantial value for the

economy's future. The influx, coupled with the opening of new markets at
the end of the Cold War, energized Israel's economy, which grew rapidly in
the early 1990s. But growth began slowing in 1996 when the government
imposed tighter fiscal and monetary policies and the immigration bonus
petered out.
