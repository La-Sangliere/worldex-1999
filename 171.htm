Background:</b> 

Italy failed to secure political unification until the 1860s, thus lacking
the military and imperial power of Spain, Britain, and France. The fascist
dictatorship of MUSSOLINI after World War I, led to the disastrous alliance
with HITLER's Germany and defeat in World War II. Italy was a founding
member of the European Economic Community (EEC) and joined in the growing

political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the
introduction of the euro in January 1999. On-going problems include illegal
immigration, the ravages of organized crime, high unemployment, and the low
incomes and technical standards of Southern Italy compared with the North.

Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Since World War II, the Italian economy has changed from one based on
agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the same
total and per capita output as France and the UK. This basically

capitalistic economy is still divided into a developed industrial north,
dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south,
with large public enterprises and more than 20% unemployment. Most raw
materials needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements must be
imported. In the second half of 1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect

of not qualifying to participate in EU plans for economic and monetary
union later in the decade; thus, it finally began to address its huge
fiscal imbalances. Subsequently, the government has adopted fairly
stringent budgets, abandoned its inflationary wage indexation system, and
started to scale back its generous social welfare programs, including

pension and health care benefits. In December 1998, Italy adopted a budget
compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU);
representatives of government, labor, and employers agreed to an update of
the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought
Italy's inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. In 1999, Italy

must adjust to the loss of an independent monetary policy, which it has
used quite liberally in the past to help cope with external shocks. Italy
also must work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, and
tackle the informal economy.
