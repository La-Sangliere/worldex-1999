Location:</b> 
body of water between Antarctica, Asia, Australia, and the Western
Hemisphere

<b>
Area:</b> 
<br><i>

total:</i> 
165.384 million sq km 


<br><i>
note:</i> 
includes Bali Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Coral
Sea, East China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of Tonkin, Java Sea,

Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South
China Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies



<p>
<b>
Area&#151;comparative:</b> 

about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (followed by the
Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about
one-third of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the
world



<p>
<b>
Coastline:</b> 
135,663 km 



<p>
<b>
Climate:</b> 

planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns exhibit
remarkable uniformity in the south and east; trade winds and westerly winds
are well-developed patterns, modified by seasonal fluctuations; tropical
cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico from June to October and
affect Mexico and Central America; continental influences cause climatic
uniformity to be much less pronounced in the eastern and western regions at

the same latitude in the North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is
monsoonal&#151;a rainy season occurs during the summer months, when
moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a dry season
during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian landmass back
to the ocean; tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike southeast and east

Asia from May to December


<p>
<b>
Terrain:</b> 
surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a clockwise,
warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in the southern
Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the northern Pacific,
sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in winter; in the
southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica reaches its northernmost extent
in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East

Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches,
including the Mariana Trench, which is the world's deepest

<b>
Elevation extremes:</b>

Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench -10,924 m

<p>
<b>
Natural resources:</b> 
oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates,
placer deposits, fish 



<p>
<b>
Natural hazards:</b> 
surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes
referred to as the "Pacific Ring of Fire"; subject to tropical cyclones
(typhoons) in southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent
from July to October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of

Mexico and strike Central America and Mexico from June to October (most
common in August and September); southern shipping lanes subject to
icebergs from Antarctica; cyclical El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast
of Peru, when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial
countercurrent moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary food

source for anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to better feeding
grounds, causing resident marine birds to starve by the thousands because
of the loss of their food source; ships subject to superstructure icing in
extreme north from October to May and in extreme south from May to October;
persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime hazard from June

to December


<p>
<b>
Environment&#151;current issues:</b> 
endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals,
turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea


<p>
<b>
Environment&#151;international agreements:</b> 
<br><i>

none of the selected agreements

<br><i>

none of the selected agreements



<p>
<b>
Geography&#151;note:</b> 

the major chokepoints are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,
and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the
North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; dotted with low coral
islands and rugged volcanic islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides
low-cost sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing
grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the
construction industry. In 1996, over 60% of the world's fish catch came

from the Pacific Ocean. Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is
playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, NZ,
China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,
combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has
slowed but not stopped new drillings.
