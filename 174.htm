Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high
technology, and a comparatively small defense allocation (1% of GDP) have
helped Japan advance with extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second most
powerful economy in the world. One notable characteristic of the economy is
the working together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in
closely knit groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been the

guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban
labor force; this guarantee is eroding. Industry, the most important sector
of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels.
The much smaller agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected,
with crop yields among the highest in the world. Usually self-sufficient in

rice, Japan must import about 50% of its requirements of other grain and
fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and
accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. For three decades overall real
economic growth had been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5%
average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly

in 1992-95 largely because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during the
late 1980s and contractionary domestic policies intended to wring
speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Growth picked
up to 3.9% in 1996, largely a reflection of stimulative fiscal and monetary
policies as well as low rates of inflation. But in 1997-98 Japan

experienced a wrenching recession, centered about financial difficulties in
the banking system and real estate markets and exacerbated by rigidities in
corporate structures and labor markets. In early 1999 output has started to
stabilize as emergency government spending begins to take hold. The
crowding of habitable land area and the aging of the population are two

major long-run problems.
