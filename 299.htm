<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the most important
economic component of the former Soviet Union, producing about four times
the output of the next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated
more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided
substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other
republics. Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and

raw materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the former
USSR. Ukraine depends on imports of energy, especially natural gas. Shortly
after the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, the Ukrainian Government
liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for privatization,
but widespread resistance to reform within the government and the

legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to some backtracking.
Output in 1992-98 fell to less than half the 1991 level. Loose monetary
policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels in late 1993. Since
his election in July 1994, President KUCHMA has pushed economic reforms,
maintained financial discipline, and tried to remove almost all remaining

controls over prices and foreign trade. The onset of the financial crisis
in Russia dashed Ukraine's hopes for its first year of economic growth in
1998 due to a sharp fall in export revenue and reduced domestic demand.
Although administrative currency controls will be lifted in early 1999,
they are likely to be reimposed when the hryvnia next comes under pressure.

The currency is only likely to collapse further if Ukraine abandons tight
monetary policies or threatens default. Despite increasing pressure from
the IMF to accelerate reform, significant economic restructuring remains
unlikely in 1999.
