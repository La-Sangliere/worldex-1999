Background:</b> 
Beset by ethnic and civil strife since independence from the Soviet Union
in December 1991, Georgia began to stabilize in 1994. Political settlements
for separatist conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia remain elusive. The
conflict in South Ossetia has been dormant since spring 1994, but sporadic
violence continues between Abkhaz forces and Georgian partisans in western
Georgia. Russian peacekeepers are deployed in both regions and a UN

Observer Mission is operating in Abkhazia. As a result of these conflicts,
Georgia still has about 250,000 internally displaced people. In 1995,
Georgia adopted a new constitution and conducted generally free and fair
nationwide presidential and parliamentary elections. In 1996, the
government focused its attention on implementing an ambitious economic

reform program and professionalizing its parliament. Violence and organized
crime were sharply curtailed in 1995 and 1996, but corruption remains rife.
Georgia has taken some steps to reduce its dependence on Russia, acquiring
coastal patrol boats in 1997 to replace Russian border units along the
Black Sea coast. In 1998, Georgia assumed control of its Black Sea coast

and about half of its land border with Turkey in line with a June 1998
agreement with Russia. Since 1997, Georgia's parliament has sharpened its
rhetoric against Russia's continued military presence on Georgian
territory. In February 1998 an assassination attempt was made against
President SHEVARDNADZE by supporters of the late former president Zviad

GAMSAKHURDIA. In October 1998, a disaffected military officer led a failed
mutiny in western Georgia; the armed forces continue to feel the ripple
effect of the uprising. Georgia faces parliamentary elections this fall,
and presidential elections next spring. After two years of robust growth,
the economy, hurt by the financial crisis in Russia, slowed in 1998.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around Black Sea tourism;
cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of manganese and
copper; and output of a small industrial sector producing wine, metals,
machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The country imports the bulk of its
energy needs, including natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable

internal energy resource is hydropower. Despite the severe damage the
economy has suffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of the IMF
and World Bank, made substantial economic gains since 1995, increasing GDP
growth and slashing inflation. The Georgian economy suffered some setbacks
in late 1998, including a large budget deficit due to a failure to collect

tax revenue and to the impact of the Russian economic crisis. Georgia also
still suffers from energy shortages; it privatized the distribution network
in 1998, and deliveries are steadily improving. Georgia is pinning its
hopes for long-term recovery on the development of an international
transportation corridor through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i and

Bat'umi. The construction of a Caspian oil pipeline through Georgia&#151;scheduled to open in early 1999&#151;should spur greater Western investment in
the economy. The global economic slowdown, a growing trade deficit,
continuing problems with corruption, and political uncertainties cloud the
short-term economic picture.
