<p>
<p>The Director of Central Intelligence heads both the U.S. Intelligence Community 
  and the Central Intelligence Agency. As a result of these dual roles, this Web 
  site includes information about both the Intelligence Community and the Central 
  Intelligence Agency (see the <a href="47.htm" target="">DCI's welcome 
  page</a>). For the purpose of the notices which follow, we will refer to this 
  entire Web site as the Central Intelligence Agency Web site since 'Central Intelligence 
  Agency' is a more widely known name than is 'Director of Central Intelligence.' 
  The notices which follow apply equally to all areas of this Web site. 
<h3><a name="priv"></a>Privacy Notice</h3>
<p>When you visit the Director of Central Intelligence/Central Intelligence Agency 
  Web site [hereafter, the Central Intelligence Agency Web site] to browse information 
  it contains, you do so anonymously. If you do nothing during your visit but 
  browse through the Web site-reading pages, viewing photographs, or downloading 
  information for example-we will gather and store certain information about your 
  visit automatically. <B>This information does not identify you personally</B>.
<p>This gathering and storing of information is separate from the activity described 
  as monitoring in our Security Notice.
<p>The information gathered is used for two purposes: site management and, in 
  the case of suspected unauthorized activity, for law enforcement and possible 
  criminal prosecution (see <a href="14.htm#sec">Security Notice</a>). 
<p>The Central Intelligence Agency Web site automatically logs visitor information 
  from which summary statistics are created. We use the summary statistics to 
  help us make our site more useful to visitors, such as assessing what information 
  is of most and least interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining 
  the site's technical design specifications and identifying system performance 
  or problem areas.
<p>The following are representative of the types of information automatically 
  collected and stored about your visit: 
<ul>
  <li>the Internet domain and Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you access 
    our Web site; </li>
  <li>the type of Internet browser and the operating system of the computer you 
    use to access our site; </li>
  <li>the date and time you visit our site; </li>
  <li>the pages you visit on our site; </li>
  <li>if you linked to our Web site from another Web site, the address of that 
    Web site; </li>
  <li>and, if you linked to our Web site from a search Web site, the address of 
    that Web site and the search term you used.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies</h3>
<p>The Central Intelligence Agency Web site does <b>NOT</b> use the &quot;cookies&quot; 
  that some Web sites use to gather and store information about your visits to 
  their sites. 
<p>Cookies are essentially tokens of information, such as preferences and passwords, 
  that some Web servers collect from you when you access them. That data is stored 
  on your hard drive-not on the Web site's server. Whenever you visit a &quot;cookie&quot; 
  site, the server looks for its cookie on your hard drive and, if found, then 
  reads the information it stored there. Cookies generally are stored in your 
  browser's directory or folder in a file named cookie.txt (MagicCookie on a Macintosh).

<h3><a name="sec"></a>Security Notice</h3>
<p>This system and related software and equipment are intended solely for the 
  communication, transmission, processing, and storage of U.S. Government information. 
  For site security purposes and to ensure that this Web site remains available 
  to all users, the Central Intelligence Agency monitors network traffic to identify 
  unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or to otherwise cause 
  damage to the site. <b>Anyone using this Web site expressly consents to such 
  monitoring</b>. 
<p>Unauthorized attempts to modify any information stored on this system, to defeat 
  or circumvent security features, or to utilize this system for other than its 
  intended purposes are prohibited and may result in criminal prosecution.
<p>If monitoring reveals evidence of possible criminal activity, such evidence 
  may be provided to law enforcement personnel.

<h3><a name="general"></a>General Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Information presented on this Web site is considered public information and 
  may be distributed or copied freely unless identified as being subject to copyright

  be cited as the source of any information, photos, and images copied from this 
  site and that any photo credits or bylines be similarly credited to the photographer

<p>We strongly recommend that Central Intelligence Agency data be acquired directly 
  from this Web site and not through other sources that may change the information 
  in some way or exclude material crucial to the understanding of that information. 
  An actual example of the latter is a commercial Web site that copied the <a href="51.htm">CIA 
  World Factbook</a> to its Web site, but excluded 17 pages of Notes and Definitions 
  that provide a framework for understanding the content of the Factbook. While 
  the Central Intelligence Agency makes every effort to provide accurate and complete 
  information, some information may change between site updates. Substantive changes 
  may be noted when content is next updated.</p>
