<A NAME="1"></A><B>What does the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) do?</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>The Central Intelligence Agency's primary mission is to collect, evaluate, 
    and disseminate foreign intelligence to assist the President and senior US 
    Government policymakers in making decisions relating to the national security. 
    The Central Intelligence Agency does not make policy; it is an independent 
    source of foreign intelligence information for those who do. The Central Intelligence 
    Agency may also engage in covert action at the President's direction in accordance 
    with applicable law. [<A HREF="20.htm#top">Return to top</A>]</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="2"></A><B>Who works for the Central Intelligence Agency?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>The CIA carefully selects well-qualified people in nearly all fields of study. 
    Scientists, engineers, economists, linguists, mathematicians, secretaries, 
    accountants and computer specialists are but a few of the professionals continually 
    in demand.&nbsp; Much of the Agency’s work, like that done in academic institutions, 
    requires research, careful evaluation, and writing of reports that end up 
    on the desks of this nation’s policymakers.&nbsp; Applicants are expected 
    to have a college degree with a minimum GPA of 3.0 and must be willing to 
    relocate to the Washington, D.C., area.&nbsp; Selection for Agency employment 
    is highly competitive and employees must successfully complete a polygraph 
    and medical examination and a background investigation before entering on 
    duty.&nbsp; The Agency endorses equal employment opportunity for all employees.&nbsp; 
    For further information, see our <A HREF="17.htm">employment 
    page</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; [<A HREF="20.htm#top">Return to top</A>]</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="3"></A><B>How many people work for the Central Intelligence Agency
and what is its budget?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>Neither the number of employees nor the size of the Agency's budget can, 
    at present, be publicly disclosed. A common misconception is that the Agency 
    has an unlimited budget, which is far from true. While classified, the budget 
    and size of the CIA are known in detail and scrutinized by the Office of Management 
    and Budget and by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Permanent 
    Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Defense Subcommittees of the Appropriations 
    Committees in both houses of Congress. The resources allocated to the CIA 
    are subject&nbsp; to the same rigorous examination and approval process that 
    applies to all other government organizations. </p>
  <p>In 1997, the aggregate figure for all U.S. government intelligence and intelligence-related 
    activities—of which the CIA is but one part--was made public for the first 
    time.&nbsp; The aggregate intelligence budget was $26.6 billion in fiscal 
    year <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/press_release/archives/1997/pr101597.html">1997</A> and $26.7 
    billion for fiscal year <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/press_release/archives/1998/ps032098.html">1998</A>.&nbsp; 
    The intelligence budget for fiscal year 1999 has not been publicly released.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="tours"></A><B>Does the Central Intelligence Agency give public
tours of its headquarters buildings?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>No. Logistical problems and security considerations prevent such tours. The 
    CIA provides an extremely limited number of visits annually for approved academic 
    and civic groups.&nbsp; A brief <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/information/tour/tour.html">virtual 
    tour</A> is available on this Web site. [<A HREF="20.htm#top">Return to top</A>]</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="4"></A><B>Does the Central Intelligence Agency release publications
to the public?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>Yes.&nbsp; The CIA releases millions of pages of documents each year.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Much of this is material of historical significance or personal interest that 
    has been declassified under Executive Order 12958 (a presidential order outlining 
    a uniform system for handling national security information) or the Freedom 
    of Information Act and Privacy Act (statutes which give U.S. citizens access 
    to U.S. Government information or U.S. Government information about themselves, 
    respectively).&nbsp; The Agency handles thousands of cases each year and maintains 
    the <A HREF="http://www.foia.ucia.gov/">CIA’s Electronic Document Release Center</A> 
    at www.foia.ucia.gov to release this information to the public and to provide 
    guidance for requesting information. Some released information of significant 
    public interest or historical value is also available at the <A HREF="http://www.nara.gov/">National 
    Archives and Records Administration</A>.&nbsp; Specific copies of any previously 
    declassified records are available directly from the CIA FOIA office. </p>
  <P>The Agency frequently releases items of more general public interest on this 
    Web site.&nbsp;&nbsp; The site includes general information <A HREF="15.htm">about 
    the CIA</A>, unclassified current <A HREF="18.htm">publications</A>,

    reports on foreign economic or political matters, maps, and directories of 
    foreign officials are also available in hard copy; these are listed in <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/mapspub/index.html">CIA

<A NAME="5"></A><B>Does the CIA spy on Americans? Does it keep a file on
you?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>By law, the CIA is specifically prohibited from collecting foreign intelligence 
    concerning the domestic activities of US citizens. Its mission is to collect 
    information related to foreign intelligence and foreign counterintelligence. 
    By direction of the President in <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/information/eo12333.html">Executive 
    Order 12333</A> of 1981 and in accordance with procedures issued by the Director 
    of Central Intelligence and approved by the Attorney General, the CIA is restricted 
    in the collection of intelligence information directed against US citizens. 
    Collection is allowed only for an authorized intelligence purpose; for example, 
    if there is a reason to believe that an individual is involved in espionage 
    or international terrorist activities. The CIA's procedures require senior 
    approval for any such collection that is allowed, and, depending on the collection 
    technique employed, the sanction of the Attorney General and Director of Central 
    Intelligence may be required. These restrictions on the CIA have been in effect 
    since the 1970s.&nbsp; [<A HREF="20.htm#top">Return to top</A>]</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="6"></A><B>Who decides when CIA should participate in covert actions,
and why?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>Only the president can direct the CIA to undertake a covert action. Such 
    actions usually are recommended by the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/NSC/html/nschome.html">National 
    Security Council</A> (NSC). Covert actions are considered when the NSC judges 
    that US foreign policy objectives may not be fully realized by normal diplomatic 
    means and when military action is deemed to be too extreme an option. Therefore, 
    the Agency may be directed to conduct a special activity abroad in support 
    of foreign policy where the role of the US Government is neither apparent 
    nor publicly acknowledged. Once tasked, the Director of Central Intelligence 
    must notify the intelligence oversight committees of the Congress. [<A HREF="20.htm#top">Return

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="9"></A><B>What is the Central Intelligence Agency's role in combating
international terrorism?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>The Central Intelligence Agency supports the overall US Government effort 
    to combat international terrorism by collecting, analyzing, and disseminating 
    intelligence on foreign terrorist groups and individuals. The CIA also works 
    with friendly foreign governments and shares pertinent information with them.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="assass"></A><B>The CIA has been accused of conducting assassinations
and engaging in drug trafficking.&nbsp; What are the facts?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>The CIA does neither.&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/information/eo12333.html">Executive 
    Order 12333</A> of 1981 explicitly prohibits the Central Intelligence Agency 
    from engaging, either directly or indirectly, in assassinations.&nbsp; Internal 
    safeguards and the congressional oversight process assure compliance. </p>
  <P>Regarding recent allegations of CIA involvement in drug trafficking,
the CIA Inspector General* found no evidence to substantiate the charges
that the CIA or its employees conspired with or assisted Contra-related
organizations or individuals in drug trafficking to raise funds for the
Contras or for any other purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the CIA plays a
crucial role in combating drug trafficking by providing intelligence information
to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
and the State Department.

<A NAME="over"></A><B>Who oversees the CIA?&nbsp; Does it act on its own
initiative?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <p>Both the Congress and the Executive Branch oversee the Central Intelligence 
    Agency’s activities. In addition, the CIA is responsible to the American people 
    through their elected representatives, and, like other government agencies, 
    acts in accordance with US laws and executive orders.&nbsp; In the Executive 
    Branch, the National Security Council—including the President, the Vice President, 
    the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense—provides guidance and 
    direction for national foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities. 
    In Congress, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent 
    Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as other committees, closely monitor 
    the Agency’s reporting and programs.&nbsp; The CIA is not a policy-making 
    organization; it advises policymakers on matters of foreign intelligence, 
    and it conducts covert actions only at the direction of the President. [<a href="20.htm#top">Return
