Background:</b> 
Russia, a vast Eurasian expanse of field, forest, desert, and tundra, has
endured many "times of trouble"&#151;the Mongol rule of the 13th to 15th
century; czarist reigns of terror; massive invasions by Swedes, French, and
Germans; and the deadly communist period (1917-91) in which Russia
dominated an immense Soviet Union. General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV, in
charge during 1985-91, introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika

(restructuring) in an attempt to modernize communism, but also
inadvertently released forces that shattered the USSR into 15 independent
republics in December 1991. Russia has struggled in its efforts to build a
democratic political system and market economy to replace the strict
social, political, and economic controls of the communist period. These

reform efforts have resulted in contradictory and confusing economic and
political regulations and practices. Industry, agriculture, the military,
the central government, and the ruble have suffered, but Russia has
successfully held one presidential, two legislative, and numerous regional
elections since 1991. The severe illnesses of President Boris YEL'TSIN have

contributed to a lack of policy focus at the center.

Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Seven years after the collapse of the USSR, Russia is still struggling to
establish a modern market economy and achieve strong economic growth.

Russian GDP has contracted an estimated 43% since 1991, including a 5% drop
in 1998, despite the country's wealth of natural resources, its
well-educated population, and its diverse&#151;although increasingly
dilapidated&#151;industrial base. By the end of 1997, Russia had achieved some
progress. Inflation had been brought under control, the ruble was

stabilized, and an ambitious privatization program had transferred
thousands of enterprises to private ownership. Some important
market-oriented laws were also passed, including a commercial code
governing business relations and an arbitration court for resolving

economic disputes. But in 1998, the Asian financial crisis swept through
the country, contributing to a sharp decline in russia's earnings from oil
exports and resulting in an exodus of foreign investors. Matters came to a
head in August 1998 when the government allowed the ruble to fall
precipitously and stopped payment on $40 billion in ruble bonds. Ongoing

problems include an undeveloped legal and financial system, poor progress
on restructuring the military-industrial complex, and persistently large
budget deficits, largely reflecting the inability of successive governments
to collect sufficient taxes. Russia's transition to a market economy has
also been slowed by the growing prevalence of payment arrears and barter

and by widespread corruption. The severity of Russia's economic problems is
dramatized by the large annual decline in population, estimated by some
observers at 800,000 people, caused by environmental hazards, the decline
in health care, and the unwillingness of people to have children.
