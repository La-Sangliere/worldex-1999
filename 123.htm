Background:</b> 
One of the four great ancient civilizations, Egypt, ruled by powerful
pharaohs, bequeathed to Western civilization numerous advances in
technology, science, and the arts. For the last two millennia, however,
Egypt has served a series of foreign masters&#151;Persians, Greeks, Romans,
Byzantines, Arabs, Turks, and the British. Formal independence came in
1922, and the remnants of British control ended after World War II. The

completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1981 altered the time-honored place of
the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing
population will stress Egyptian society and resources as it enters the new
millenium.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
At the end of the 1980s, Egypt faced problems of low productivity and poor
economic management, compounded by the adverse social effects of excessive
population growth, high inflation, and massive urban overcrowding. In the
face of these pressures, in 1991 Egypt undertook wide-ranging macroeconomic

stabilization and structural reform measures. This reform effort has been
supported by three IMF arrangements, the last of which expired in September
1998. Egypt's reform efforts&#151;and its participation in the Gulf war
coalition&#151;also led to massive debt relief under the Paris Club
arrangements. Substantial progress has been made in improving macroeconomic

performance. Cairo tamed inflation, slashed budget deficits, and built up
foreign reserves to an all-time high. Although the pace of structural
reforms&#151;such as privatization and new business legislation&#151;has been
slower than envisioned under the IMF program, Egypt's steps toward a more
market-oriented economy have prompted increased foreign investment. The

November 1997 massacre of foreign tourists in Luxor affected tourism enough
to slow the GDP growth rate for 1998 compared to earlier projections.
Tourism's slow recovery, coupled with low world oil prices, caused a
downturn in foreign exchange earnings in 1998, but external payments are
not in crisis.
