Background:</b> 
The 1995 Abuja Peace Accords ended seven years of civil warfare in Liberia.
More than 20,000 of the estimated 33,000 factional fighters gave up their
arms to the Cease-Fire Monitoring Group of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOMOG). Free and open presidential and legislative
elections were held 19 July 1997; former faction leader, Charles TAYLOR,
and his National Patriotic Party won overwhelming victories. The years of

civil strife coupled with the flight of most business people disrupted
formal economic activity. A short-lived armed clash in September 1998
between government forces and supporters of factional leader Roosevelt
JOHNSON and continuing uncertainty about the security situation have slowed
the process of rebuilding the social and economic structure of the war-torn

country. For two centuries the US has had uniquely close ties to Liberia
and today is a major aid donor.

Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
A civil war in 1989-97 has destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially
the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Many businessmen have fled the
country, taking capital and expertise with them. Some returned during 1997.

Many will not return. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources,
forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a
producer and exporter of basic products, while local manufacturing, mainly
foreign owned, had been small in scope. The democratically elected
government, installed in August 1997, inherited massive international debts

and currently relies on revenues from its maritime registry to provide the
bulk of its foreign exchange earnings. The restoration of the
infrastructure and the raising of incomes in this ravaged economy depends
on the implementation of sound macro- and micro-economic policies of the
new government, including the encouragement of foreign investment.
