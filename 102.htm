Background:</b> 
For most of its 3,500 years of history, China led the world in agriculture,
crafts, and science, then fell behind in the 19th century when the
Industrial Revolution gave the West clear superiority in military and
economic affairs. In the first half of the 20th century, China continued to
suffer from major famines, civil unrest, military defeat, and foreign
occupation. After World War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established

a dictatorship that, while ensuring China's autonomy, imposed strict
controls over all aspects of life and cost the lives of tens of millions of
people. After 1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping decentralized economic
decision making; output quadrupled in the next 20 years. Political controls
remain tight at the same time economic controls have been weakening.

Present issues are: incorporating Hong Kong into the Chinese system;
closing down inefficient state-owned enterprises; modernizing the military;
fighting corruption; and providing support to tens of millions of displaced
workers.

Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to move the
economy from a sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy to a more
market-oriented economy but still within a rigid political framework of
Communist Party control. To this end the authorities switched to a system
of household responsibility in agriculture in place of the old

collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and plant
managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in
services and light manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased
foreign trade and investment. The result has been a quadrupling of GDP
since 1978. Agricultural output doubled in the 1980s, and industry also

posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and opposite
Taiwan, where foreign investment helped spur output of both domestic and
export goods. On the darker side, the leadership has often experienced in
its hybrid system the worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude,
corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation).

Beijing thus has periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at
intervals. In late 1993 China's leadership approved additional long-term
reforms aimed at giving still more play to market-oriented institutions and
at strengthening the center's control over the financial system; state

enterprises would continue to dominate many key industries in what was now
termed "a socialist market economy". In 1995-97 inflation dropped sharply,
reflecting tighter monetary policies and stronger measures to control food
prices. At the same time, the government struggled to (a) collect revenues
due from provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce corruption and

other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large state-owned
enterprises, most of which had not participated in the vigorous expansion
of the economy and many of which had been losing the ability to pay full
wages and pensions. From 60 to 100 million surplus rural workers are adrift
between the villages and the cities, many subsisting through part-time

low-paying jobs. Popular resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of
authority by rural cadres have weakened China's population control program,
which is essential to maintaining growth in living standards. Another
long-term threat to continued rapid economic growth is the deterioration in
the environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall

of the water table especially in the north. China continues to lose arable
land because of erosion and economic development. The next few years may
witness increasing tensions between a highly centralized political system
and an increasingly decentralized economic system. Economic growth probably
will slow to more moderate levels in 1999-2000.
