Background:</b> 
In 1895, military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan to Japan, however it
reverted to Chinese control after World War II. Following the Communist
victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million Nationalists fled to Taiwan and
established a government that over five decades has gradually democratized

and incorporated native Taiwanese within its structure. Throughout this
period, the island has prospered as one of East Asia's economic tigers. The
dominant political issue continues to be the relationship between Taiwan
and Mainland China and the question of eventual reunification.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with gradually decreasing guidance
of investment and foreign trade by government authorities and partial

government ownership of some large banks and industrial firms. Real growth
in GDP has averaged about 8.5% a year during the past three decades. Export
growth has been even faster and has provided the impetus for
industrialization. Inflation and unemployment are low, and foreign reserves
are the world's third largest. Agriculture contributes less than 3% to GDP,

down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily
being moved off-shore and replaced with more capital- and
technology-intensive industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in
China, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The
tightening of labor markets has led to an influx of foreign workers, both

legal and illegal. Because of its conservative financial approach and its
entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little compared with many of its
neighbors from "the Asian flu" in 1998.
