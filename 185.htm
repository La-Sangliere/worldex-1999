Background:</b> 
At the end of World War II, the US and the Soviet Union agreed that US
troops would accept the surrender of Japanese forces south of the 38th
parallel and the Soviet Union would do so in the north. In 1948, the UN

proposed nationwide elections; after P'yongyang's refusal to allow UN
inspectors in the north, elections were held in the south and the Republic
of Korea was established. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was
established the following month in the north. Communist North Korean forces
invaded South Korea in 1950. US and other UN forces intervened to defend

the South and Chinese forces intervened on behalf of the North. After a
bitter three-year war, an armistice was signed in 1953, establishing a
military demarcation line near the 38th parallel. Thereafter, South Korea
achieved amazing economic growth, with per capita output rising to 13 times
the level in the North. Since late 1997, however, the nation has suffered

widespread financial and organizational difficulties. Continuing tensions
between North and South have raised concerns of provocative military
actions by the North.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
As one of the Four Dragons of East Asia, South Korea has achieved an
incredible record of growth. Three decades ago its GDP per capita was
comparable with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia. Today
its GDP per capita is seven times India's, 13 times North Korea's, and
already near the lesser economies of the European Union. This success
through the late 1980s was achieved by a system of close government

business ties, including directed credit, import restrictions, sponsorship
of specific industries, and a strong labor effort. The government promoted
the import of raw materials and technology at the expense of consumer goods
and encouraged savings and investment over consumption. The Asian financial
crisis of 1997-98 exposed certain longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's

development model, including high debt/equity ratios, massive foreign
borrowing, and an undisciplined financial sector. By the end of 1998 it had
recovered financial stability, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves to
record levels by running a current account surplus of $40 billion. As of
December 1998, the first tentative signs of a rebound in the economy

emerged, and most forecasters expect GDP growth to turn positive at least
in the second half of 1999. Seoul has also made a positive start on a
program to get the country's largest business groups to swap subsidiaries
to promote specialization, and the administration has directed many of the
mid-sized conglomerates into debt-workout programs with creditor banks.

Challenges for the future include cutting redundant staff, which reaches
20%-30% at most firms and maintaining the impetus for structural reform.
