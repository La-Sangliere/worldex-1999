<P>
In addition to the updating of information, the following changes have been made in this edition of <I>The World Factbook</I>.  The name Wake Island has been officially changed to Wake Atoll. The <B>Historical perspective</B> and <B>Current issues</B> entries in the <B>Introduction</B> category have been combined into a new <B>Background</B> entry. It appears in only a few country profiles at this time. There are new entries on <B>Population below poverty line, Household income or consumption by percentage share, Electricity&#151;production by source</B> (fossil fuel, hydro, nuclear, other), <B>Electricity&#151;exports</B>, and <B>Electricity&#151;imports</B>.  A new reference map of Kosovo has been included and terrain has been added to most of the reference maps.
<P>
<B>Abbreviations:</B>
 This information is included in <B><A href="356.htm">Appendix A: Abbreviations</A></B>, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in the <I>Factbook</I>, with their expansions.

<P>
<B>Administrative divisions:</B>
 This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.
<P>
<B>Age structure:</B>
 This entry provides the distribution of the population according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues. For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to find employment can lead to unrest.
<P>
<B>Agriculture&#151;products:</B>
 This entry is a rank ordering of major crops and products starting with the most important.
<P>
<B>Airports:</B>
 This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s) may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.
<P>
<B>Airports&#151;with paved runways:</B>
 This entry gives the total number of airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces). For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is included according to the following five groups &#151;(1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m.

<P>
<B>Appendixes:</B>
 This section includes <I>Factbook</I>-related material by topic.
<P>
<B>Area:</B>
 This entry includes three subfields. <I>Total area</I> is the sum of all land and <I>water areas</I> delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines. <I>Land area</I> is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). <I>Water area</I> is the sum of all water surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).

<P>
<B>Birth rate:</B>
 This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.
<P>
<B>Budget:</B>

<P>
<B>Communications&#151;note:</B>
 This entry includes miscellaneous communications information of significance not included elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Constitution:</B>
 This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major amendments.
<P>
<B>Country map:</B>
 Most versions of the <I>Factbook</I> provide a country map in color. The maps were produced from the best information available at the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.
<P>
<B>Country name:</B>
 This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): <I>conventional long form</I> (Italian Republic), <I>conventional short form</I> (Italy), <I>local long form</I> (Repubblica Italiana), <I>local short form</I> (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the <I>abbreviation</I>. Also see the <B>Terminology</B> note.
<P>
<B>Currency:</B>
 This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and its basic subunit.
<P>
<B>Data code:</B>
 This entry gives the official US Government digraph that precisely identifies every land entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the data code for Afghanistan. This two-letter country code is a standardized geopolitical data element promulgated in the <I>Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 10-4</I> by the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US Department of State. The data code is used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing, and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful for interchanging data between databases. <B><A href="357.htm">Appendix F</A></B> cross-references various country data codes and <B><A href="358.htm">Appendix G</B></A> does the same thing for hydrographic data codes.
<P>
<B>Data codes&#151;country:</B>
 This information is presented in <B><A href="357.htm">Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes</A></B> which includes the US Government approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and Internet codes for land entities.
<P>
<B>Data codes&#151;hydrographic:</B>
 This information is presented in Appendix G: Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes which includes the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart and Information Center (ACIC; now National Imagery and Mapping Agency or NIMA) codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) codes for hydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet approved a standard for hydrographic data codes similar to the FIPS 10-4 standard for country data codes.
<P>
<B>Date of information:</B>
 In general, information available as of 1 January 1999, was used in the preparation of this edition.
<P>
<B>Death rate:</B>
 This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.
<P>
<B>Debt&#151;external:</B>
 This entry gives the total amount of public foreign financial obligations.
<P>
<B>Dependency status:</B>
 This entry describes the formal relationship between a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.

<P>
<B>Disputes&#151;international:</B>
 This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by the US Government.
<P>
<B>Economic aid&#151;donor:</B>
 This entry refers to net official development assistance (ODA) from OECD nations to developing countries and multilateral organizations. ODA is defined as financial assistance that is concessional in character, has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. The entry does not cover other official flows (OOF) or private flows.
<P>
<B>Economic aid&#151;recipient:</B>
 This entry, which is subject to major problems of definition and statistical coverage, refers to the net inflow of Official Development Finance (ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance from the World Bank, the IMF, and other international organizations and from individual nation donors. Formal commitments of aid are included in the data. Omitted from the data are grants by private organizations. Aid comes in various forms including outright grants and loans. The entry thus is the difference between new inflows and repayments.

<P>
<B>GDP:</B>
 This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP dollar estimates in the <I>Factbook</I> are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations. See the note on <B>GDP methodology</B> for more information.
<P>
<B>GDP methodology:</B>
 In the <B>Economy</B> section, GDP dollar estimates for all countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights, which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy.  The data derived from the PPP method provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between countries.  The division of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate.  Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations.  Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In contrast, currency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output. In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data can <I>not</I> be chained together from successive volumes of the <I>Factbook</I> because of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of information, and changes in national statistical methods and practices.  For statistical series on GDP and other economic variables, see the <I>Handbook of International Economic Statistics</I> available from the same sources as <I>The World Factbook</I>.
<P>
<B>GDP&#151;composition by sector:</B>
 This entry gives the percentage contribution of <I>agriculture, industry</I>, and <I>services</I> to total GDP.

<P>
<B>Geographic coordinates:</B>
 This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the purpose of finding the approximate geographic center of an entity and is based on the <I>Gazetteer of Conventional Names</I>, Third Edition, August 1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.
<P>
<B>Geographic names:</B>
 This information is presented in <B><A href="359.htm">Appendix H: Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names</A></B> which indicates where various geographic names&#151;including alternate names, former names, political or geographical portions of larger entities, and the location of all US Foreign Service posts&#151;can be found in <I>The World Factbook</I>. Spellings are normally, but not always, those approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names are included in parentheses, while additional information is included in brackets.
<P>
<B>Geography:</B>
 This category includes the entries dealing with the natural environment and the effects of human activity.
<P>
<B>Geography&#151;note:</B>
 This entry includes miscellaneous geographic information of significance not included elsewhere.
<P>
<B>GNP:</B>
 Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production. The <I>Factbook</I>, following current practice, uses GDP rather than GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize that in certain countries net remittances from citizens working abroad may be important to national well-being.
<P>
<B>Government:</B>
 This category includes the entries dealing with the system for the adoption and administration of public policy.
<P>

<P>
<B>Highways:</B>
 This entry includes the total length of the highway system as well as the length of the paved and unpaved components.
<P>
<B>Household income or consumption by percentage share:</B>
 Data on household income or consumption come from household surveys, the results adjusted for household size. Nations use different standards and procedures in collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys based on income will normally show a more unequal distribution than surveys based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time, yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country comparisons.
<P>
<B>Illicit drugs:</B>
 This entry gives information on the five categories of illicit drugs&#151;narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold outside of medical channels.
<BR>
<img src="360.gif">Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).
<BR>
<img src="360.gif">Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.

<P>
<B>Life expectancy at birth:</B>
 This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry includes total population as well as the male and female components. Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human capital and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial measures.
<P>
<B>Literacy:</B>
 This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common definition&#151;the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of the <I>Factbook</I>. Information on literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.
<P>

The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from being extended the full distance.
<P>
<B>Merchant marine:</B>
 Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage of goods; all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; or a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register. This entry contains information in two subfields&#151;<I>total and ships by type</I>. <I>Total</I> includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for those ships, and total GRT for those ships. <I>Ships by type</I> includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo ships, combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers, container ships, intermodal ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock carriers, multifunction large&#151;load carriers, oil tankers, passenger ships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships, specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and vehicle carriers.  
<BR>
<img src="360.gif">A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a territory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent country; it is also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.
<BR>
<img src="360.gif">A flag of convenience register is a national register offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.
<BR>
<img src="360.gif">A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how a ship is crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.
An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset of a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on the main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign nationals as crew members, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.
<BR>
<img src="360.gif">A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of freight; it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial vessels only.
<BR>
<img src="360.gif">A register is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a country; also, it is the compendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.
<P>
<B>Military:</B>
 This category includes the entries dealing with a country's military structure, manpower, and expenditures.
<P>
<B>Military branches:</B>
 This entry lists the names of the ground, naval, air, marine, and other defense or security forces.
<P>
<B>Military expenditures&#151;dollar figure:</B>
 This entry gives current military expenditures in US dollars; the figure is calculated by multiplying the estimated defense spending in percentage terms by the gross domestic product (GDP) calculated on an exchange rate basis not purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. The figure should be treated with caution because of different price patterns and accounting methods among nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of their currencies.
<P>
<B>Military expenditures&#151;percent of GDP:</B>
 This entry gives current military expenditures as an estimated percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
<P>
<B>Military manpower&#151;availability:</B>
 This entry gives the total numbers of males and females age 15-49 and assumes that every individual is fit to serve.
<P>
<B>Military manpower&#151;fit for military service:</B>
 This entry gives the number of males and females age 15-49 fit for military service. This is a more refined measure of potential military manpower availability which tries to correct for the health situation in the country and reduces the maximum potential number to a more realistic estimate of the actual number fit to serve.
<P>
<B>Military manpower&#151;military age:</B>
 This entry gives the minimum age at which an individual may volunteer for military service or be subject to conscription.
<P>

<P>
<B>Net migration rate:</B>
 This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in certain key sectors (if people are leaving).
<P>
<B>People:</B>
 This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics of the people and their society.
<P>
<B>People&#151;note:</B>
 This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of significance not included elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Personal Names&#151;Capitalization:</B>
  The <I>Factbook</I> capitalizes the surname or family name of individuals for the convenience of our users who are faced with a world of different cultures and naming conventions. An example would be President SADDAM Husayn of Iraq. Saddam is his name and Husayn is his father's name. He may be referred to as President SADDAM Husayn or President SADDAM, but not President Husayn. The need for capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or some other indicator of the individual's surname is apparent in the following examples:  MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz, William Jefferson CLINTON, and TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah.  By knowing the surname, a short form without all capital letters can be used with confidence as in President Saddam, President Castro, Chairman Mao, President Clinton, or Sultan Tunku Salahuddin.  The same system of capitalization is extended to the names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly used such as Queen ELIZABETH II.  
<P>
<B>Personal Names&#151;Spelling:</B>
  The romanization of personal names in the <I>Factbook</I> normally follows the same transliteration system used by the US Board on Geographic Names for spelling place names.  At times, however, a foreign leader expressly indicates a preference for, or the media or official documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the transliteration derived from the US Government standard.  In such cases, the <I>Factbook</I> uses the alternative spelling.
<P>
<B>Personal Names&#151;Titles:</B>
  The <I>Factbook</I> capitalizes any valid title (or short form of it) immediately preceding a person's name.  A title standing alone is lowercased. Examples:  President YEL'TSIN and President CLINTON are chiefs of state.  In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier is the head of the government, while in the US, the president is both chief of state and head of government.  
<P>
<B>Pipelines:</B>
 This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.
<P>
<B>Political parties and leaders:</B>

<P>
<B>Political pressure groups and leaders:</B>
 This entry includes a listing of organizations with leaders involved in politics, but not standing for legislative election.
<P>
<B>Population:</B>
 This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on assumptions about future trends. The total population presents one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and within its region. Note: starting with the 1993 <I>Factbook</I>, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have taken into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS infections.  These countries are Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
<P>
<B>Population below poverty line:</B>
 National estimates of the percentage of the population lying below the poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions of poverty vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations.     
<P>
<B>Population growth rate:</B>
 The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.
<P>
<B>Ports and harbors:</B>
 This entry lists the major ports and harbors selected on the basis of overall importance to each country.  This is determined by evaluating a number of factors (e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage, facilities, military significance).
<P>
<B>Radio broadcast stations:</B>
 This entry includes the total number of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.
<P>

<P>
<B>Religions:</B>
 This entry includes a rank ordering of religions starting with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population.
<P>
<B>Sex ratio:</B>
 This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age groups&#151;<I>at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over</I>, and for the <I>total population</I>. Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually it could cause unrest among young adult males who are unable to find partners.  The sex ratio at birth for the World is 1.06 (1999 est.).
<P>
<B>Suffrage:</B>
 This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to vote is universal or restricted.
<P>
<B>Telephone numbers:</B>
 All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required) in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not presented is the international access code, which varies from country to country. For example, an international direct dial telephone call placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:

<UL>
<P>011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where  
<br>011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls  
<br>(01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),  
<br>[34] is the country code for Spain,  
<br>(1) is the city code for Madrid,  
<br>577 is the local exchange, and  
<br>xxxx is the local telephone number.  
  </UL>
<P>An international direct dial telephone call placed from another country
to the US would be as follows: 

<P>
<UL>
international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where 
<br>[1] is the country code for the US,  
<br>(202) is the area code for Washington, DC,  
<br>939 is the local exchange, and  
<br>xxxx is the local telephone number.

<B>Terminology:</B>
 Due to the highly structured nature of the <I>Factbook</I> database, some collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word <B>Country</B> in the <B>Country name</B> entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states. <B>Military</B> is also used as an umbrella term for various civil defense, security, and defense activities in many entries. The <B>Independence</B> entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and former ruling states as well as other significant nationhood dates such as the traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession that are not strictly independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their dependency status noted in this same entry.

<B>Total fertility rate:</B>
 This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential for population growth in the country. High rates will also place some limits on the labor force participation rates for women. Large numbers of children born to women indicate large family sizes that might limit the ability of the families to feed and educate their children.
