a disaggregation of the two ethnic communities inhabiting the island began
after the outbreak of communal strife in 1963; this separation was further
solidified following the Turkish intervention in July 1974 following a
Greek junta-based coup attempt, which gave the Turkish Cypriots de facto
control in the north; Greek Cypriots control the only internationally
recognized government; on 15 November 1983 Turkish Cypriot "President" Rauf

DENKTASH declared independence and the formation of a "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" (TRNC), which has been recognized only by Turkey; both
sides publicly call for the resolution of intercommunal differences and
creation of a new federal system of government

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

Economic affairs are dominated by the division of the country into the
southern (Greek) area controlled by the Cyprus Government and the northern
Turkish Cypriot-administered area. The Greek Cypriot economy is prosperous
but highly susceptible to external shocks. Erratic growth rates in the
1990s reflect the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals,
caused by political instability on the island and fluctuations in economic

conditions in Western Europe. Economic policy in the south is focused on
meeting the criteria for admission to the EU. As in the Turkish sector,
water shortage is a growing problem, and several desalination plants are
planned. The Turkish Cypriot economy has about one-fifth the population and
one-third the per capita GDP of the south. Because it is recognized only by

Turkey, it has had much difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign
firms have hesitated to invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent
on agriculture and government service, which together employ about half of
the work force. Moreover, the small, vulnerable economy has suffered

because the Turkish lira is legal tender. To compensate for the economy's
weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to nearly every sector,
e.g. tourism, education, and industry.
