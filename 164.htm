<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

India's economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern
agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a
multitude of support services. 67% of India's labor force work in
agriculture, which contributes 25% of the country's GDP. Production, trade,
and investment reforms since 1991 have provided new opportunities for

Indian businesspersons and an estimated 300 million middle class consumers.
New Delhi has avoided debt rescheduling, attracted foreign investment, and
revived confidence in India's economic prospects since 1991. Many of the
country's fundamentals&#151;including savings rates (26% of GDP) and reserves
(now about $30 billion)&#151;are healthy. Even so, the Indian Government needs

to restore the early momentum of reform, especially by continuing
reductions in the extensive remaining government regulations. India's
exports, currency, and foreign institutional investment were affected by
the East Asian crisis in late 1997 and 1998; but capital account controls,
a low ratio of short-term debt to reserves, and enhanced supervision of the

financial sector helped insulate it from near term balance-of-payments
problems. Exports fell 5% in 1998 mainly because of the fall in Asian
currencies relative to the rupee. Energy, telecommunications, and
transportation bottlenecks continue to constrain growth. A series of weak

coalition governments have lacked the political strength to push reforms
forward to address these and other problems. Indian think tanks project GDP
growth of about 4.5% in 1999. Inflation will remain a worrisome problem.

<b>
Telephone system:</b> 

mediocre; local and long distance service provided throughout all regions
of the country, with services primarily concentrated in the urban areas;
major objective is to continue to expand and modernize long-distance
network in order to keep pace with rapidly growing number of local

subscriber lines; steady improvement is taking place with the recent
admission of private and private-public investors, but demand for
communication services is also growing rapidly


<br><i>
domestic:</i> 
local service is provided by microwave radio relay and coaxial cable, with
open wire and obsolete electromechanical and manual switchboard systems

still in use in rural areas; starting in the 1980s, a substantial amount of
digital switch gear has been introduced for local- and long-distance
service; long-distance traffic is carried mostly by coaxial cable and
low-capacity microwave radio relay; since 1985, however, significant trunk
capacity has been added in the form of fiber-optic cable and a domestic

satellite system with 254 earth stations; cellular telephone service in
four metropolitan cities

<br><i>

international:</i> 
satellite earth stations&#151;8 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) and 1 Inmarsat (Indian
Ocean Region); four gateway exchanges operating from Mumbai, New Delhi,
Calcutta, and Chennai; submarine cables to Malaysia, UAE, Singapore, and

Japan
