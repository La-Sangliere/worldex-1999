Background:</b> 

As a republic within the USSR (1920-91), Kazakhstan suffered greatly from
Stalinist purges, from environmental damage, and saw the ethnic Russian
portion of its population rise to 37% while other non-Kazakhs made up
almost 20%. Current issues include the pace of market reform and
privatization; fair and free elections and democratic reform; ethnic
differences between Russians and Kazakhs; environmental problems; and how

to convert the country's abundant energy resources into a better standard
of living.

been diverted for irrigation, it is drying up and leaving behind a harmful

layer of chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then
picked up by the wind and blown into noxious dust storms; pollution in the
Caspian Sea; soil pollution from overuse of agricultural chemicals and
salination from faulty irrigation practices

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet republics in territory,
possesses enormous untapped fossil fuel reserves as well as plentiful
supplies of other minerals and metals. It also has considerable
agricultural potential with its vast steppe lands accommodating both

livestock and grain production. Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the
extraction and processing of these natural resources and also on a
relatively large machine building sector specializing in construction
equipment, tractors, agricultural machinery, and some defense items. The
breakup of the USSR and the collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional

heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy
since 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97
the pace of the government program of economic reform and privatization
quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets into the private
sector. The December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium

agreement to build a new pipeline from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil
field to the Black Sea increases prospects for substantially larger oil
exports in several years. Kazakhstan's economy turned downward in 1998 with
a 2.5% decline in GDP growth due to slumping oil prices and the August
financial crisis in Russia. 1999 will also be a difficult year.
