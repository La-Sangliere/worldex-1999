two equal width horizontal bands of red (top) and blue separated by a

are separated from the green band and its arms by narrow white stripes


<br><i>
note:</i> 

prior to 26 April 1994, the flag was actually four flags in one&#151;three
miniature flags reproduced in the center of the white band of the former
flag of the Netherlands, which has three equal horizontal bands of orange
(top), white, and blue; the miniature flags are a vertically hanging flag
of the old Orange Free State with a horizontal flag of the UK adjoining on

the hoist side and a horizontal flag of the old Transvaal Republic
adjoining on the other side

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

South Africa is a middle-income, developing country with an abundant supply
of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and
transport sectors, a stock exchange that ranks among the 10 largest in the
world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of
goods to major urban centers throughout the region. However, growth has not
been strong enough to cut into the 30% unemployment, and daunting economic

problems remain from the apartheid era, especially the problems of poverty
and lack of economic empowerment among the disadvantaged groups. Other
problems are crime and corruption. The new government demonstrated its
commitment to open markets, privatization, and a favorable investment
climate with the release of its macroeconomic strategy in June 1996. Called

"Growth, Employment and Redistribution," this policy framework includes the
introduction of tax incentives to stimulate new investment in
labor-intensive projects, expansion of basic infrastructure services, the
restructuring and partial privatization of state assets, continued
reduction of tariffs, subsidies to promote economic efficiency, improved

services to the disadvantaged, and integration into the global economy.
Serious structural rigidities remain, including a complicated and
relatively protectionist trade regime, and concentration of wealth and
economic control.
