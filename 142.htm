Background:</b> 
Germany&#151;first united in 1871&#151;suffered defeats in successive world wars
and was occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and
the Soviet Union in 1945. With the beginning of the Cold War and increasing

tension between the US and Soviet Union, two German states were formed in
1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German
Democratic Republic (GDR). The newly democratic FRG embedded itself in key
Western economic and security organizations, the EU and NATO, while the
Communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The

decline of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War cleared the path for
the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German re-unification in 1990.
Germany has expended considerable funds&#151;roughly $100 billion a year&#151;in
subsequent years working to bring eastern productivity and wages up to
western standards, with mixed results. Unemployment&#151;which in the east is

nearly double that in the west&#151;has grown over the last several years,
primarily as a result of structural problems like an inflexible labor
market. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other members of the EU formed a
common European currency, the euro, and the German government is now
looking toward reform of the EU budget and enlargement of the Union into

Central Europe.

Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Germany possesses the world's third most powerful economy, with its
capitalist market system tempered by generous welfare benefits. On 1

January 1999, Germany and 10 other European Union countries launched the
European Monetary Union (EMU) by permanently fixing their bilateral
exchange rates and giving the new European Central Bank control over the
zone's monetary policy. Germans expect to have the new European currency,
the euro, in pocket by 2002. Domestic demand contributed to a moderate

economic upswing in early 1998, although unemployment remains high.
Job-creation measures have helped superficially, but structural rigidities&#151;like high wages and costly benefits&#151;make unemployment a long-term, not
just a cyclical, problem. Although minimally affected by the Asian crisis
in 1998, Germany revised its 1999 forecast downward at the beginning of the

year to reflect anticipated effects from the global economic slowdown. Over
the long term, Germany faces budgetary problems&#151;lower tax revenues and
higher pension outlays&#151;as its population ages. Meanwhile, the German
nation continues to wrestle with the integration of eastern Germany, whose
adjustment may take decades to complete despite annual transfers from the

west of roughly $100 billion a year.

includes roaming service to many foreign countries; since the reunification
of Germany, the telephone system of the eastern region has been upgraded
and enjoys all of the advantages of the national system
