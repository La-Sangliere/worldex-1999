<H1>A Word From the Deputy Director...</H1>


<P>Welcome to the home page of the CIA's analytic arm, the Directorate of Intelligence!

<P>You will find information--some of it made publicly available for the first time--about the Directorate's mission, how we are organized to accomplish it, how we do our business, the many disciplines that we draw on, and samples of some of our publications.  I hope you will find it stimulating, informative, and useful.  We will be keeping an eye out for new material to put on the home page as it becomes available.

<P>For the Directorate of Intelligence, like the CIA, the past decade has been one of challenges and opportunities.  With the end of the Cold War, our analysts have been called on as never before to give US policymakers sufficient warning of impending threats to the United States and its people anywhere around the world.

<P>These include an increasingly wide range of complex international threats--from weapons proliferation, to narcotics trafficking and organized crime, to terrorism, to environmental challenges. They also include more traditional threats to the United States and its friends and allies--from hostile or potentially hostile countries, and from volatile regional situations.

<P>Providing timely, objective, and insightful analysis on these issues has contributed to efforts which protect lives and bolster security and peace around the world.

<P>We can do this only because of an exceptionally talented, knowledgable, diverse, and dedicated professional workforce that is constantly renewing its skills and expertise, employing new technologies, and working closely with other parts of the CIA and Intelligence Community.

<P>We can do this only with the support and engagement of the American public that we serve.

<P>We welcome you to this Directorate of Intelligence home page and hope you enjoy its contribution to the CIA Website!

					<P>-- John E. McLaughlin<BR>
				     Deputy Director for Intelligence<BR>
				        Central Intelligence Agency
