Background:</b> 
At the end of World War II, the US and the Soviet Union agreed that US
troops would accept the surrender of Japanese forces south of the 38th
parallel and the Soviet Union would do so in the north. In 1948, the UN
proposed nationwide elections; after P'yongyang's refusal to allow UN
inspectors in the north, elections were held in the south and the Republic
of Korea was established. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was

established the following month in the north. Communist North Korean forces
invaded South Korea in 1950. US and other UN forces intervened to defend
the South and Chinese forces intervened on behalf of the North. After a
bitter three-year war, an armistice was signed in 1953, establishing a
military demarcation line near the 38th parallel. The North's heavy

investment in military forces has produced an army of 1 million troops
equipped with thousands of tanks and artillery pieces. Despite growing
economic hardships, North Korea continues to devote a significant portion
of its scarce resources to the military.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
North Korea is the world's most centrally planned economy. Agricultural
land is collectivized, state-owned industry produces nearly all

manufactured goods, and heavy and military industries have long been
developed at the expense of light and consumer industries. Open-air markets
since 1995 have gained increasing importance in the distribution of food
and consumer goods but private production remains extremely limited. Total
economic output has fallen steadily since 1991&#151;perhaps by as much as

one-half&#151;when the country's economic ties to the Soviet Union and Eastern
Bloc collapsed. The slide has also been fueled by serious energy shortages,
aging industrial facilities, and a lack of maintenance and new investment.
The leadership has tried to maintain a high level of military spending but

the armed forces have nonetheless been affected by the general economic
decline. Although North Korea has long depended on imports to meet food
needs, serious fertilizer shortages in recent years have combined with
structural constraints&#151;such as a shortage of arable land and a short
growing season&#151;to reduce staple grain output to more than 1 million tons

below what the country needs to meet even minimal demand. Widespread famine
and disease have cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of North Koreans
in 1994-98. The US, China, the international community, and nongovernmental
organizations have sent aid but the problems remain extremely serious.
