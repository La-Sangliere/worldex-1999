in 1994, about a million refugees fled into Zaire (now called the
Democratic Republic of the Congo or DROC), to escape the fighting between
the Hutus and the Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi; the outbreak of widespread
fighting in the DROC between rebels and government forces in October 1996
spurred about 875,000 refugees to return to Rwanda in late 1996 and early
1997; additionally,the DROC is host to 200,000 Angolan, 110,000 Burundi,

100,000 Sudanese, and 15,000 Ugandan refugees; renewed fighting in the DROC
in August 1998 resulted in more internal displacement and refugee outflows

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

The economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#151;a nation endowed with
vast potential wealth&#151;has declined significantly since the mid-1980s. The
new government instituted a tight fiscal policy that initially curbed
inflation and currency depreciation, but these small gains were quickly
reversed when the foreign-backed rebellion in the eastern part of the

country began in August 1998. The war has dramatically reduced government
revenue, and increased external debt. Foreign businesses have curtailed
operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict and because
of increased government harassment and restrictions. Poor infrastructure,

an uncertain legal framework, corruption, and lack of transparency in
government economic policy remain a brake on investment and growth. A
number of IMF and World Bank missions have met with the new government to
help it develop a coherent economic plan but associated reforms are on
hold.
