Background:</b> 
In and out of Swedish and Russian control over the centuries, this little
Baltic state was re-incorporated into the USSR after German occupation in
World War II. Independence came with the collapse of the USSR in 1991; the

last Russian troops left in 1994. Estonia thus became free to promote
economic and political ties with Western Europe. The position of ethnic
Russians (29% of the population) remains an issue of concern to Moscow.
European Union (EU) membership negotiations, which began in 1998, remain a
domestic issue.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 
Estonia's continued adherence to market reforms, disciplined fiscal and
monetary policies, and a liberal free trade regime resulted in GDP growth
in 1998 of 5.5% and a decrease in inflation to 6.5% from 11.2% in 1997. A
high but slightly decreased current account deficit was estimated at 8.6%.
The fall in GDP growth is largely due to the impact of Russia's financial
crisis and reduced investment in emerging markets in the wake of the Asian

financial crisis. Like other small emerging markets, Estonia will face
difficulties in 1999 as a result of continuing fallout from Asia. Key
events of 1998 were the start of official EU accession talks, banking
sector consolidation&#151;nine banks were reduced to five&#151;and the important
role that Swedish capital played in the large banks (Swedbank's acquisition

of a majority stake in Hansapank has accounted for the large increase in
foreign direct investment). The IMF urged Estonia to maintain a stable
economy and good reputation in international markets and to avoid populist
policies in the run-up to March 1999 parliamentary elections. The
government completed restructuring of state-controlled Estonian Telecom,

the sale of 49% of which will be the flagship privatization in 1999 and the
largest public equity transaction in the Baltics. Estonia expects to join
the World Trade Organization in 1999.
