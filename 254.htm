Background:</b> 
Throughout their colonial rule, first Germany and then Belgium favored
Rwanda's minority Tutsi ethnic group in education and employment. In 1959,
the majority ethnic group, the Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi monarch.

The Hutus killed hundreds of Tutsis and drove tens of thousands into exile
in neighboring countries. The children of these exiles later formed a rebel
group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and began a civil war in October
1990. The war, along with several political and economic upheavals,
exasperated ethnic tensions culminating in April 1994 in a genocide in

which roughly 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. The Tutsi
rebels defeated the Hutu regime and ended the genocide in July 1994, but
approximately 2 million Hutu refugees&#151;many fearing Tutsi retribution&#151;fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire, now called the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC). According to the UN Office of the

High Commissioner for Refugees, in 1996 and early 1997 nearly 1.3 million
Hutus returned to Rwanda. Even with substantial international aid, these
civil dislocations have hindered efforts to foster reconciliation and to
boost investment and agricultural output. Although much of the country is
now at peace, members of the former regime continue to destabilize the

northwest area of the country through a low-intensity insurgency. Rwandan
troops are currently involved in a crisis engulfing neighboring DROC.

Tutsi and Hutu factions, more than 2 million refugees fled to neighboring
Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly
Zaire); according to the UN High Commission on Refugees, in 1996 and early
1997 nearly 1.3 million Hutus returned to Rwanda&#151;of these 720,000

returned from Democratic Republic of the Congo, 480,000 from Tanzania,
88,000 from Burundi, and 10,000 from Uganda; probably fewer than 100,000
Rwandans remained outside of Rwanda by the end of 1997

Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

Rwanda is a rural country with about 90% of the population engaged in
(mainly subsistence) agriculture. It is the most densely populated country
in Africa; is landlocked, and has few natural resources and minimal
industry. Primary exports are coffee and tea. The 1994 genocide decimated
Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely impoverished the population,

particularly women, and eroded the country's ability to attract private and
external investment. However, Rwanda has made significant progress in
stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy. GDP has rebounded, and
inflation has been curbed. In June 1998, Rwanda signed an Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) with the IMF. Rwanda has also

embarked upon an ambitious privatization program with the World Bank.
