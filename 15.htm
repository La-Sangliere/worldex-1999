<p>The Central Intelligence Agency was created in 1947 with the signing of the 
  National Security Act by President Truman.&nbsp; The National Security Act charged 
  the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) with coordinating the nation's intelligence 
  activities and correlating, evaluating, and disseminating intelligence which 
  affects national security. </p>
<p><A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/information/tenet.html">George J. Tenet</A> was confirmed July 10, 1997, as the 
  current Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).&nbsp; The DCI serves as head 
  of the United States Intelligence Community, principal advisor to the President 
  for Intelligence matters related to national security, and head of the Central 
  Intelligence Agency (CIA). </p>
<p>The CIA is an independent agency, responsible to the President through the 
  DCI, and accountable to the American people through the intelligence oversight 
  committees of the U.S. Congress. </p>
<p>CIA's mission is to support the President, the National Security Council, and 
  all officials who make and execute U.S. national security policy by: </p>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <p> Providing accurate, comprehensive, and timely foreign intelligence on 
      national security topics</p>
  </LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <p> Conducting counterintelligence activities, special activities, and other 
      functions related to foreign intelligence and national security, as directed 
      by the President.</p>
  </LI>
</UL>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the CIA engages in research, development, and deployment 
  of high-leverage technology for intelligence purposes.&nbsp; As a separate agency, 
  CIA serves as an independent source of analysis on topics of concern and works 
  closely with the other organizations in the Intelligence Community to ensure 
  that the intelligence consumer--whether Washington policymaker or battlefield 
  commander--receives the best intelligence possible. </p>
<p>As changing global realities have reordered the national security agenda, the 
  CIA has met these new challenges by: </p>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <p> Creating special, multidisciplinary centers to address high-priority issues 
      such as nonproliferation, counterterrorism, counterintelligence, international 
      organized crime and narcotics trafficking, environment, and arms control 
      intelligence.</p>
  </LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <p> Forging stronger partnerships between the several intelligence collection 
      disciplines and all-source analysis.</p>
  </LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <p> Taking an active part in Intelligence Community analytical efforts and 
      producing all-source analysis on the full range of topics that affect national 
      security.</p>
  </LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <p> Contributing to the effectiveness of the overall Intelligence Community 
      by managing services of common concern in imagery analysis and open-source 
      collection and by participating in strategic partnerships with other intelligence 
      agencies in the areas of research and development and technical collection.</p>
  </LI>
</UL>
<p>By emphasizing adaptability in intelligence collection, the CIA can tailor 
  its support to key intelligence consumers <BR>
  to help meet their needs as they face the issues of the post-Cold War world.
