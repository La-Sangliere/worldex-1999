Background:</b> 

Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959, and his guiding vision
has defined Cuba's Communist revolution while his iron will has held the
country together for more than four decades. CASTRO brought Cuba onto the
world stage by inviting Soviet support in the 1960s, inciting revolutionary
movements throughout Latin America and Africa in the 1970s, and sending his
army to fight in Angola in the 1980s. At home, Havana provided Cubans with

high levels of healthcare, education, and social security while suppressing
the Roman Catholic Church and arresting political dissidents. Cuba is
slowly recovering from severe economic recession following the withdrawal
of former-Soviet subsidies, worth $4billion-$6 billion per year, in 1990.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

The state plays the primary role in the economy and controls practically
all foreign trade. The government has undertaken several reforms in recent
years to stem excess liquidity, increase labor incentives, and alleviate
serious shortages of food, consumer goods, and services. The liberalized
agricultural markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private

farmers sell above-quota production at unrestricted prices, have broadened
legal consumption alternatives and reduced black market prices. Government
efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the
money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to
move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the

dollar by yearend 1998. New taxes introduced in 1996 helped drive down the
number of self-employed workers from 208,000 in January 1996 to 155,000 by
July 1998. Havana announced in 1995 that GDP declined by 35% during
1989-93, the result of lost Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. The
drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth,

followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again
in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. Export earnings declined
22% in 1998, to $1.4 billion, the result of lower sugar export volume and
lower world prices for nickel and sugar. Import expenditures also fell 15%
to $3.0 billion, in part due to lower world oil prices. Tourism and

remittances play a key role in foreign currency earnings. Living standards
for the average Cuban remain at a depressed level compared with 1990.
