Background:</b> 
On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the former Yugoslavia's three warring
parties signed a peace agreement that brought to a halt over three years of

interethnic civil strife in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the final agreement was
signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Agreement, signed then by
Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian
President MILOSEVIC, divides Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally between
the Muslim/Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska while maintaining

Bosnia's currently recognized borders. In 1995-96, a NATO-led international
peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia to implement
and monitor the military aspects of the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a
smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission is to deter
renewed hostilities. SFOR remains in place. A High Representative appointed

by the UN Security Council is responsible for civilian implementation of
the accord, including monitoring implementation, facilitating any
difficulties arising in connection with civilian implementation, and
coordinating activities of the civilian organizations and agencies in
Bosnia. The Bosnian conflict began in the spring of 1992 when the

government of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum on independence and
the Bosnian Serbs&#151;supported by neighboring Serbia&#151;responded with armed
resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and
joining Serb-held areas to form a "greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosnia's
Muslims and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from three to two

by signing an agreement in Washington creating their joint Muslim/Croat
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Federation, formed by the Muslims
and Croats in March 1994, is one of two entities (the other being the
Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska) that comprise Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Government&#151;note:</b> 
Until declaring independence in spring 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina existed
as a republic in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia was partitioned by fighting
during 1992-95 and governed by competing ethnic factions. Bosnia's current
governing structures were created by the Dayton Agreement, the 1995 peace

agreement which was officially signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 by then
Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and then Serbian
President MILOSEVIC. This agreement retained Bosnia's exterior border and
created a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national
government&#151;based on proportional representation similar to that which

existed in the former socialist regime&#151;is charged with conducting
foreign, economic, and fiscal policy. The Dayton Agreement also recognized
a second tier of government, comprised of two entities&#151;a joint
Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska (RS)&#151;each
presiding over roughly one-half the territory. The Federation and RS

governments are charged with overseeing internal functions.

<b>
Economy&#151;overview:</b> 

Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav federation. Although
agriculture has been almost all in private hands, farms have been small and
inefficient, and the republic traditionally has been a net importer of
food. Industry has been greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the
rigidities of communist central planning and management. TITO had pushed

the development of military industries in the republic with the result that
Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The bitter
interethnic warfare in Bosnia caused production to plummet by 80% from 1990
to 1995, unemployment to soar, and human misery to multiply. With an uneasy
peace in place, output has recovered in 1996-98 at high percentage rates on

a low base, but remains far below the 1990 level. Key achievements in 1998
included approval of privatization legislation, the introduction of a
national currency&#151;the convertible mark, agreement with the Paris Club to
reschedule official debt, and the conclusion of a Standby Agreement with
the IMF. Economic data are of limited use because, although both entities

issue figures, national-level statistics are not available. Moreover,
official data do not capture the large share of activity that occurs on the
black market. The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction
assistance and humanitarian aid from the international community. Wide
regional differences in war damage and access to the outside world have

resulted in substantial variations in living conditions among local areas
and individual families. In 1999, Bosnia's major goals are to implement
privatization and make progress in fiscal reform and management. In
addition, Bosnia will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance
from the international community.
